**WeatherPy**

A Python script is used to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator. Using a simple Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API,  a representative model of weather across world cities is created with a series of scatter plots.


The following relationships are analyzed:

**Temperature vs. Latitude**

Northern Hemisphere

**VacationPy**

This script further explores the OpenWeatherMap API by displaying weather data that matches the parameters for an ideal vacation.
